<p>Architectural needs of a software product are inherently different to the needs of a bespoke application. This is because, the uncertanities of <code>operational context</code>, <code>competition factors</code> and <code>possible user groups</code> do demand much higher degree of architectural flexibility from a product.</p>

<p> If you are an ISV, interested in a futuristic but standard driven product architecture that will boost your time-to-market, you are at the right company here.</p>

<p>Simply put, Codekernel is a Microsoft technology based middleware architecture for a sophisticated software product development project!</p>

</p>

<p>With Codekernel we've crafted a platform providing necessary plumbing code for most of the common architectural needs of a software product. Go ahead, just download and run the solution to see the sample application in action. You can easily start building new features by following our <a href="#">documentation and tutorials</a>.

Following are some of the design practices you will get off-the-shelf with Codekernel.


<h5>Data Layer</h5>
<ul><li>Generic base classes for unit of work', 'repository' patterns using Entity Framework</li>
<li>Standard practices for 'Seed data handling' and 'migrations'</li></ul>

<h5>Logic Layer</h5>
<ul><li>Cleanly separated behaviour code (fast changing) from domain model (slow changing)</li>
<li>Clean request/response driven business logic service classes to obay SRP</li>
<li>Workflow foundation based business process engine for business rule configurability [TBD]</li>
<li>Best practices for software product edition management and licensing [TBD]</li>
</ul>

<h5>Service Layer</h5>
<ul><li>Generic Web API controller classes for exposing your entities as OData services</li>
<li>Support for comprehensive OData query options including $filter, $select, $expand etc.</li>
<li>Concurrency conflict handling on your OData services</li></ul>

<h5>Presentation Layer</h5>
<ul>
<li>Powerful library integration for a default 'Single Page Application (SPA)' frontend</li>
<li>Ability to introduce different presentations (e.g. ASP.NET MVC, Native mobile, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Security</h5>
<ul><li>Comprehensive auth model with support for basic, forms and OAuth schemes [TBD]</li>
<li>Strong protection against common vulnarabilities such as CSRF, injection attacks etc [TBD]</li></ul>

<h5>Cloud Support</h5>
<ul><li>Off-the-shelf Microsoft Azure platform compatibility [TBD]</li>
<li>Abstractions to support both in-cloud and out-cloud deployment [TBD]</li>
<li>Multitenancy support for deliverign software as a service [TBD]</li></ul>

<h5>Testing</h5>
<ul><li>Over 90% test coverage for complete the serverside code base</li>
<li>Generic integration tests to verify CRUD operations on your repositories</li>
<li>Generic self hosted integration tests to very your Web API OData services </li>
<li>Test framework to test your clientside Javascript logic [TBD]</li></ul>
